# Portfolio Project - Company Database

This Repository will hold all of the code and queries from the Project.

We'll be looking at database management basics and SQL using the MySQL RDBMS. Also, We'll be getting our hands on various topics including schema design, basic C.R.U.D operations, aggregation, nested queries, joins, keys and much more.
Please feel free to take these and run with them. Make them your own and find you own insights.

I really do hope this is helpful.
